 **Dashboard**
   - Main interface for AI learning tools.
   - Left sidebar or top navigation with options:
     - Summarize Notes
     - Generate Quizzes
     - Create Flashcards
     - Activity History
     - Learn Page

4. **AI Note Summarizer**
   - Users paste large text/notes or upload a `.txt` or `.docx` file.
   - Summarize into concise points using a function like `summarize_text(text)` (simulate OpenAI summarizer).
   - Display summarized results in an elegant UI card.

5. **Quiz Generator**
   - Use the AI-generated summaries to automatically generate 3–5 multiple-choice questions.
   - Output should include:
     - Questions
     - Four options (A–D)
     - Highlight the correct answer
   - Use a function like `generate_quiz(summary_text)`.

6. **Flashcard Creator**
   - From the same summary, generate flashcards in Q&A format.
   - Display as flip cards with JavaScript or a scrollable deck.
   - Each card should have front (question/concept) and back (answer/definition).

7. **Real-Time Activity History**
   - Log all recent user activities:
     - Summaries created
     - Quizzes taken
     - Flashcards reviewed
   - Display this on the dashboard as a scrollable list (timeline or table format).
   - For now, store in localStorage or mock JSON.

8. **Learning Page**
   - Add a page to switch between:
     - Forex Topics
     - Stock Market Topics
   - Each topic displays learning cards with AI-generated micro-summaries.
   - Simulate AI summary for each topic.

### Technical Requirements:
- Use Flask for backend and routing.
- Use HTML + Tailwind CSS for frontend.
- Use vanilla JS or Fetch API to communicate with Flask endpoints.
- Place everything in a centralized `index.html`, `script.js`, `style.css`, and `main.py`.
- Provide modular functions in `main.py` like:
  - `summarize_text(text)`
  - `generate_quiz(summary)`
  - `generate_flashcards(summary)`
  - `get_quotes()`

### Bonus:
- Quotes rotate every 15 seconds on landing page.
- Use soft animations, framer motion–like feel via Tailwind and JS.
- Clean sidebar UI or topbar layout.
